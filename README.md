# Sort Three Numbers in Ascending Order (Java)

This is a simple Java program that takes three integer inputs from the user and displays them in ascending order.

## 🔧 How It Works

The program uses basic conditional checks and swapping logic to sort the three input numbers without using arrays or built-in sorting methods.

### 📌 Example Input/Output


## 💡 Logic

1. Take three numbers as input.
2. Compare and swap them using `if` conditions:
   - If `a > b`, swap `a` and `b`
   - If `a > c`, swap `a` and `c`
   - If `b > c`, swap `b` and `c`
3. Print the numbers in ascending order.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Java JDK 8 or later

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
javac AscendingOrder.java
java AscendingOrder
